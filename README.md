# repo-catalog

The fleet roster and policy for the `simpsonm09-org` organization.

The original lives in `simpsonm09-org/simpsonm09-repo-catalog`.
See [`repo-standard`](https://github.com/simpsonm09-org/simpsonm09-repo-standard).

## What it does

It holds the repositories tracked under the fleet framework, the tier of each one,
the adoption status, and the policy for the tiers. The standard holds the checks.
This repository holds only the intent that GitHub cannot report.

## Layout

- `repos.json` is the roster.
- `ignore.json` lists the organization repositories that are out of the fleet.
- `policy.md` describes the tiers and the expectations.
- `scripts/validate.mjs` fails when the roster and the organization disagree.

## Quick start

```bash
just install
just verify
```

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `just install` | Installs the pinned tools. |
| `just lint` | Runs the linters. |
| `just test` | Validates the roster against the organization. |
| `just verify` | Lints and tests. |
